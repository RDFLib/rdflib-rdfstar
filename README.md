# rdflib-rdfstar

This is the start of an RDF-Star and likely also SPARQL-Star implementation in RDFLib. Initially this work will be separate until it is in good working order and then it might be folderd into RDFLib core.

This work is being conducted as a student project at the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au).
